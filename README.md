# ArcProfilePlus

A simple userscript that shows additional info on https://arcaea.lowiro.com/en/profile/ (at the time).

The API call the client does already contains this information, so this script just displays them on your profile.

## Installing for Chrome

- Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
- View the raw source of the script [here](https://github.com/redside100/arcprofileplus/raw/master/arcProfilePlus.user.js).
- Click the install button.

If a new Tampermonkey installtion tab did not appear, you can copy the source and paste it as a new userscript on the Tampermonkey dashboard.
